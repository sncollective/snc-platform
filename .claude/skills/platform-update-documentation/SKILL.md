  Align all documentation to code after a change. Use after implementing a feature, adding a
  config key, new CLI command, new flag, or any non-trivial code change. Invoke proactively
  when finishing implementation — not only when the user asks. Discovers the project's doc
  structure dynamically rather than assuming fixed paths.

# Update Documentation

## Phase 1: Discover the Doc Structure

Before updating anything, map what documentation exists in this project.

1. **Find doc roots** — look for any of: `docs/`, `doc/`, `website/`, `site/`, `pages/`,
   `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, or equivalent at the project root.
2. **Find internal specs** — look for files named `SPEC.md`, `ARCH.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `UX.md`,
   `ADR/`, `decisions/`, or similar technical reference docs.
3. **Find public-facing docs** — look for guide pages, reference pages, or a static site.
4. **Find generated files** — look for any file that is auto-generated from others (check for
   comments like `# generated`, scripts that concatenate docs, or files named `llms-full.txt`,
   `api.md`, etc.). Note these — never edit them directly; regenerate them.
5. **Find memory** — look for `MEMORY.md` in `~/.claude/projects/…/memory/` or the project root.
6. **Find repo-specific skills** — look for `.agents/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`, or similar
   directories containing skills derived for this repo. These skills encode repo-specific
   workflows, conventions, or domain knowledge and must stay in sync with the codebase.

## Phase 2: Classify the Change

For the change that was just made, identify its category:

| Change type                                    | Typical doc owners                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| New feature / behavior                         | Spec, architecture doc, relevant guide page(s)                 |
| New CLI command or flag                        | CLI reference, spec, relevant guide page                       |
| New config key                                 | Config reference, spec, default config template                |
| Prompt / UX flow change                        | UX doc, guide page with examples                               |
| New module or interface                        | Architecture doc, API reference                                |
| Bug fix with behavior impact                   | Spec (if behavior was mis-documented), changelog               |
| Phase or milestone complete                    | Roadmap / changelog                                            |
| New stable pattern or gotcha                   | Memory file                                                    |
| Changed interface, workflow, or convention     | Repo-specific derived skills that reference it                 |
| New accepted value or alias for existing param | Tool/API reference, skills with example calls using that param |

Don't limit yourself to a fixed checklist — reason from the map you built in Phase 1.

## Phase 3: Update

**Rule 1 — Grep before reading.**
Search for the changed feature's name, flag, or function across all doc roots to find stale
references and gaps. Read only the relevant section, not the whole file.

**Rule 2 — Guide pages own the narrative.**
Where guide pages exist, they are where users learn behavior — update prose, examples, and
condition lists there. Reference pages (tables, option lists) must stay accurate too.

**Rule 3 — Regenerate generated files last.**
If any source doc changed and a generated aggregate file exists (e.g., a concatenated LLM
ingestion file, an auto-built API reference), regenerate it after all source edits are done.
Find the generation script by searching for it (`gen-`, `build-docs`, `scripts/`) or checking
`package.json` / `Makefile` tasks.

**Rule 4 — Update memory for new stable patterns, gotchas, or completed phases.**
Keep memory terse (under 200 lines). Put detail in a topic file if needed.

**Rule 5 — Do not edit generated files directly.**
If you find a file that is auto-generated, never edit it — regenerate it from source.

**Rule 6 — Sync repo-specific derived skills.**
If the change alters an interface, workflow, convention, or domain concept that a repo-specific
skill references, update that skill to match. Grep skill files for the changed names, flags, or
patterns. Skills that encode stale assumptions will silently produce wrong guidance. Pay special
attention to example calls in skills — if a parameter gains a new accepted value or alias
(e.g., `"latest"` for a session ID), update example calls in skills to use the simpler form
where it improves clarity.

## Completion Criteria

- All doc files that own the changed area have been updated
- No stale references to old behavior remain (grep-verified)
- Generated files have been regenerated if source docs changed
- Memory updated if a new stable pattern or gotcha was introduced
- Repo-specific derived skills updated if the change affects anything they reference
