# Dispatch registration — template

The dispatch-time registration declaration (ARD SPEC §9). Sets the controls for an engagement. For a single-pass walk this can live in the conversation transcript; for a multi-specialist or multi-campaign walk, persist it as a `dispatch.md` at the campaign root. The nine fields are always present (a uniform shape prevents silent default drift).

# <engagement seed / question>

Brief statement of the engagement and its decomposition (if multi-specialist).
```

Notes:
- `engagement-unit` is **not** a field — it is discovered at read-time (emergent).
- `disconfirmation-mode` is **not** a field — it derives from `scope_authority`.
- The registration informs engagement (which gates fire, which decision-points activate); it is **not** carried into the output artifacts' frontmatter — artifacts stand on their own metadata.
